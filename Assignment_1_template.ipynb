    "Joe is a physical fitness instructor organizing the annual physical fitness test, called IPPT. To do so, he designs a class named ```IPPT```, which contains a single attribute ```log```. This class is used to record the collated daily repititions of the three available ippt stations, 'situp', 'pushup' and '2.4run', so that at the end of the day, he can tally this with the machine's readings to see if anyone cheated. Complete the ```add_record``` and ```check``` methods for him.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```add_record``` method should take in ```list_of_tuples``` and update ```self.log``` appropriately. ```list_of_tuples``` is a list of tuples. Each tuple comprises two elements, the first is a string ('situp', 'pushup', or '2.4run'), and the second is a float (representing the number of reps recorded). Examples are given in the sample and test cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```check``` method should take in a ```category``` (a string - either 'situp', 'pushup', or '2.4run') and return the total amount of reps done for that category.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is guaranteed that in all test cases, the strings within `list_of_tuples` and `category` will strictly be either 'situp', 'pushup' or '2.4run'. However, you are NOT allowed to modify or add any methods or attributes except for within ```add_record``` and ```check```."
